# Unity-Mentorship-2021

Description: What is our project/game about? 
- Our game contains several encapsulated levels (min one per developer) to enable the dev team to have a good breadth of knowledge. 
- The levels are connected by some common theme/gui/open-world. Maybe a hub-world?
- Minigames have some motivation factor. Maybe leaderboard, map unlocks, better chatacter control, etc.
- Some theme ideas: Medieval Fantasy, Rogue Shooter, etc.

Tech Stack: What technologies are we using?
- Our Unity enviornment will leverage Bolt visual scripting to ease development learning curves.
- PS4 controller integration
