Your name: Nathan Babcock

Do you plan to leverage Bolt: Yes

An idea that you have for the project: I would love to make a that is a multi-floored open world game. With each floor being an open world area to level up in and a dungeon and boss to fight at the end of each floor to progress to the next.

Your desired tech stack for the project: The ps4 controller

Yes
A game with different sections that are all pretty open, but probably not a fully open world game.
