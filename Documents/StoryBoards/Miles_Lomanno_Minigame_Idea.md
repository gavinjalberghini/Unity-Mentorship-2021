Rules and goals: A pig has to roll in different piles of mud without getting caught by a human who 
keeps looking at and away from you. You win if the pig uses up every pile of mud, and you lose if the 
human catches you. You also have to finish before the time the farmer has to get to work. 

Mechanical elements: The pig will filp over and roll in mud while the circle button is held down, and
stand up when it's released. The game will switch to a game over screen if the pig is spotted by the
human, and switch to a brief "you win" screen, then go back to the hub world
 if you use up all of the mud.

Technical requirements: A movement script, human field of vision, human/losing script, a countdown/timer
